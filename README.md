# Beer Clicker

I've finally decided to learn Unity !

For fun, I started developing a clicker game centered around beers. It's simply a tavern you click on, but with fun bonuses and a unique inventory system to keep things exciting. I'm hoping to integrate an educational section that will allow players to learn a little more about the world of beer through anecdotes and/or stories.

* Optimized for 1920 x 1080 resolution.
* The game is in French during the development phase, but will be available in several languages.

I hope you enjoy it !

I used AI to generate images, such as background, icons or pnj.

This game is a clicker. Your mission, if you accept it, is simply to.... click on the screen. Each click is a beer that's drunk.

Sometimes people will come up to you and talk to you. Feel free to read them to find out more about the world of beer.

If you're lucky, you might find a special beer that gives you a mahjong piece to collect in your inventory! 

Can you collect them all?
